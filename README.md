# Prompt-Powered Kickstart: Beginner’s Toolkit for Go (Golang)

## Title & Objective
**Title:** Getting Started with Go (Golang) – A Beginner’s Guide  
**Technology Chosen:** Go (Golang), a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency.  
**Why Chosen:** Go is widely used for backend services, cloud applications, and system tools due to its performance and ease of deployment. It's a great choice for beginners looking to learn a modern language beyond Python, Java, or JavaScript.  
**End Goal:** Install Go, write a simple "Hello World" program, and run it to verify the setup.

## Quick Summary of the Technology
Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google in 2007. It's designed for building simple, reliable, and efficient software.  
**What is it?** A compiled language with garbage collection, built-in concurrency support via goroutines, and a focus on readability.  
**Where is it used?** Web servers, cloud services (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), command-line tools, and microservices.  
**Real-world Example:** Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform, is written in Go.

## System Requirements
- **OS:** Windows 11, macOS, or Ubuntu Linux  
- **Tools/Editors:** VS Code (with Go extension), Terminal/Command Prompt  
- **Packages:** Go Compiler (latest version from go.dev)  

## Installation & Setup Instructions

### Windows 11
1. Download the Windows MSI installer from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/) (choose the .msi file for your architecture).  
2. Run the installer with default settings. It will set up the Go binary in `C:\Go\bin` and add it to your PATH.  
3. Open Command Prompt and verify installation:  
   ```powershell
   go version
   ```  
   Expected output: `go version go1.x.x windows/amd64`  

### Ubuntu (WSL or Native)
1. Update your package list:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```  
2. Install Go:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install golang-go
   ```  
   Or download the latest tarball from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/), extract it to `/usr/local/go`, and add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your PATH in `~/.bashrc`.  
3. Verify installation:  
   ```bash
   go version
   ```  
   Expected output: `go version go1.x.x linux/amd64`  

### Additional Setup
- Install VS Code Go extension for syntax highlighting and debugging.  
- Set up a Go workspace (optional, but recommended): Create a directory like `~/go-workspace` and set `GOPATH` if needed (Go modules are default in newer versions).

## Minimal Working Example
This example creates a simple "Hello World" program that prints a message to the console.  

**What it does:** Prints "Hello, World from Go!" when run.  

**Code (hello.go):**  
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World from Go!")
}
```  

**How to run:**  
1. Save the code in a file named `hello.go`.  
2. Open terminal in the file's directory.  
3. Run:  
   ```bash
   go run hello.go
   ```  
   Expected output: `Hello, World from Go!`  

**Build and run executable:**  
```bash
go build hello.go
./hello  # On Windows: hello.exe
```

## AI Prompt Journal
I used AI tools like ChatGPT and Blackbox to learn Go installation, syntax, and troubleshooting. Here are key prompts and reflections:  

1. **Prompt:** "Give me a step-by-step guide to install Go on Windows 11 and Ubuntu."  
   **AI Tool:** ChatGPT  
   **Link to Curriculum:** N/A (general prompt).  
   **AI Response Summary:** Provided detailed steps for both OS, including verification commands.  
   **Helpfulness Evaluation:** Very helpful; saved time on official docs and covered common pitfalls.  

2. **Prompt:** "Explain Go package structure and how to write a Hello World program."  
   **AI Tool:** Blackbox  
   **Link to Curriculum:** N/A.  
   **AI Response Summary:** Explained `package main`, imports, and `func main()`.  
   **Helpfulness Evaluation:** Clarified concepts quickly; AI suggested best practices.  

3. **Prompt:** "How to fix 'go command not found' error after installation?"  
   **AI Tool:** ChatGPT  
   **Link to Curriculum:** N/A.  
   **AI Response Summary:** Advised checking PATH and restarting terminal.  
   **Helpfulness Evaluation:** Resolved issue immediately; improved productivity by avoiding manual searches.  

Overall, using ChatGPT and Blackbox accelerated learning by providing tailored, step-by-step guidance and error fixes, making the process efficient and beginner-friendly.

## Common Issues & Fixes
- **Issue:** `go: command not found` after installation.  
  **Fix:** Ensure Go's bin directory is in PATH. On Windows, restart Command Prompt. On Ubuntu, source `~/.bashrc` or log out/in. Reference: [Go Installation Troubleshoot](https://go.dev/doc/install#troubleshoot).  

- **Issue:** VS Code Go extension not working.  
  **Fix:** Install Go tools via `go install` commands in terminal. Reference: [VS Code Go Wiki](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki).  

- **Issue:** Module errors in newer Go versions.  
  **Fix:** Use `go mod init` to initialize a module. Reference: [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules).  

- **General Tip:** If builds fail, check for syntax errors or missing dependencies.
